Some stuff about me

Hello everyone, this is my first time in Github

Thanks a lot for this valuable space, in which i'm pretty sure will help me to leverage my programming skills as a beginner.
i'm Andre, a 30 YO guy living in colombia, whom is planning to start his own business in the programing field, but as you all know,I must start from the beginning; from the basics stuff.

This will be my path:
- Javascript 
- HTML
- Figma
- Python 
- SQL

I hope to take the biggest advantage of Github and its community and forsure share some ideas with all of you.
